Managed Reference
The `SerializeReference` attribute, added in Unity 2019.3, makes it possible to serialize references to interfaces and abstract classes.

The `ManagedReference` attribute allows you to easily set subclasses of those abstract classes in the Editor that are serialized by `SerializeReference` attribute.
